# Status Report

## Project: Bozzy

## Iteration 1

## Implementation Status

All members of our team currently have the environment set up on our own laptops.  Presently, we have a simple pop up window with the name of the project, Bozzy, with a button which reads "click me."  When this button is pushed, a print statement is executed on the console.  We also have very simple read, write and append methods which will be useful to us as we begin developing more complex features.  These three simple methods are used to read from a file, create a new file, write to a new file, or to append to an existing file. We've also set up a GitHub repository, and a continuous build using Travis.

The following is a sample screenshot to illustrate our progress:

## Highlights

The project is currently on schedule with no major setbacks.  The project manager is very well organized and is assigning workload and tasks appropriately to individual team members, taking in to consideration their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the tasks are designed to complete certain aspects and requirements of the course, such as the Project Proposal by the specified timeline given by the professor. The team is working in an agile fashion, with weekly sprints.  At this point in time, this agile work environment is working very well and efficiently, subsequently, the team is able to meet the schedule.

The team is also successfully scheduling and attending weekly hourly customer meetings where both the business analyst and project manager are present to discuss the project, and transcribing and keeping notes of the meeting for future reference and for the rest of the team to read.

## Tasks to be worked on next Iteration

Ted will complete the first working prototype of the RTF/JSON conversion scripts as they are a high risk project. Erica will display a set of strokes and translations on the graph prototype. Sophie will have a searching by translation prototype function. Ian will write and read from the file system with some dummy data to simulate back up of dictionaries in order.

We'll aim to have initially connected the core feature prototypes, with a very basic GUI that serves mainly to see how the components interact. We should design how to handle the different formats internally.
